# color_analyzer

This basic tool was built with [this lesson](https://towardsdatascience.com/building-an-image-color-analyzer-using-python-12de6b0acf74). I downloaded a different test image from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/) to generate a chart that visualizes the weights of the colors in an image. 

Comments were added for clarity, and an alternative file naming approach is included if this program is needed to analyze many files over time.
